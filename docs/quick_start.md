# Quickstart

This document provides a sequence of actions required to get started with Hive.

Steps:

1. Deploy Hive locally [on top of Minishift](./install.md#deploy-on-minishift) or on top of an existing [OpenShift cluster](./install.md#deployment-options).
Refer to the [installation](./install.md) documentation for details.

2. Once you have the Hive running, you can provision an OpenShift cluster using it.
Refer to the [using Hive](./using-hive.md) documentation for details.

If you are interested in contributing to Hive, refer to the [developing Hive](./developing.md) documentation for instructions around testing local code changes.

NOTE: For Hive supported cloud providers refer to the [supported cloud providers](../README.md#supported-cloud-providers)
